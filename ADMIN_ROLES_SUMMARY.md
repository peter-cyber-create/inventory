   - Can access: ICT, Fleet, Stores, Activities
   - Can create, edit, delete in all modules
   - Can view all reports

2. **superadmin** (also treated as admin) - Same as admin with additional privileges

6. **finance** - Finance/Activities module access

### **Role-Based Access Control:**

The `ProtectedRoute` component checks user roles:
```javascript
const hasPermission = allowedRoles.includes(userRole) || userRole === 'admin';
```

**Key Points:**
- Users with 'admin' role bypass all permission checks
- Module-specific roles (it, garage, store, finance) have limited access
- Permission checks are enforced on all routes
- Users are redirected to their default dashboard if they lack permission

## üîí **Security Features:**

1. **JWT Authentication** - All API calls require valid JWT token
2. **Role-Based Route Protection** - Frontend routes are protected by role
3. **Backend Middleware** - Auth middleware validates tokens
4. **Permission Checking** - Each route checks user permissions

## üìù **Role Structure in Database:**

The `users` table has a `role` field with possible values:
- 'admin' - System administrator
- 'superadmin' - Super administrator
- 'it' - IT department user
- 'garage' - Fleet management user
- 'store' - Stores management user
- 'finance' - Finance department user
- 'user' - Standard user (limited access)

## üéØ **Admin Capabilities:**

### **What Admins Can Do:**
1. Access all modules without restrictions
2. Manage users and permissions
3. Configure system settings
4. View all reports across all modules
5. Access admin utilities for signatory role assignment
6. Manage departments and users

### **Super Admin Capabilities:**
Super Admin has all admin capabilities plus:
1. System-level configuration access
2. Ability to assign any role to users
3. Access to system-wide analytics
4. Full audit trail access

- Multi-level access control
- Role-based permissions
- Secure authentication
- Protected routes
