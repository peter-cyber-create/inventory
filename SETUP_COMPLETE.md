## 🔧 Final Setup Step - Database Access

**The only remaining step is to configure database access. You have two options:**

### Option 1: Quick Setup (Development)
```bash
# Set a password for the MySQL root user
sudo mysql_secure_installation

# Or directly access MySQL and create the database
sudo mysql
```

In MySQL console:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE inventory_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'inventory_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON inventory_db.* TO 'inventory_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

Then update the `.env` file in `inventory-backend-master/`:
```
DB_USER=inventory_user
DB_PASS=secure_password123
```

### Option 2: Automated Setup
```bash
./setup-database.sh
```
Choose option 2 and follow the prompts.

## 🚀 Starting the Application

Once the database is configured:

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   ./start-backend.sh
   ```

2. **Start Frontend:**
   ```bash

   ```
