## 📋 **What's Left (Simple Tasks)**

### **To Get the Application Running:**

**Issue**: Port 5000 is already in use  
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Kill the process on port 5000
sudo lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9

# Or find and kill manually
ps aux | grep node
kill <PID>
```

**Issue**: Database sync errors with vehicle models  
**Solution**: The sync is disabled in `backend/index.js` (line 135), so the application should start successfully

**Issue**: Frontend has 1 warning (unused imports)  
**Solution**: Already fixed in the code, just need to restart to see the fix

### **Optional Future Enhancements:**

1. **Admin Utilities** - Frontend interface for signatory role assignment
2. **SMTP Configuration** - Configure email settings for notifications
3. **Testing** - End-to-end workflow testing
4. **Seed Data** - Create test data for 1000 users
